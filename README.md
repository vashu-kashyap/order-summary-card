- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In the order summary project, I learned how to effectively utilize HTML5 semantic elements to structure and organize the content of the webpage. Semantic elements such as     and <footer> helped me improve the accessibility and readability of the webpage.

Additionally, I explored the concept of CSS custom properties, also known as CSS variables, which allowed me to define reusable values and easily apply them across different elements. By utilizing custom properties, I could efficiently manage and update styles throughout the project, providing consistency and flexibility.

Furthermore, I implemented flexbox, a powerful CSS layout model, to create a responsive and dynamic design. Flexbox enabled me to efficiently distribute and align elements within containers, resulting in a visually appealing and adaptive layout.

Overall, this project provided valuable hands-on experience with HTML5 semantic elements, CSS custom properties, and flexbox. These skills are fundamental for building well-structured, customizable, and responsive webpages.
